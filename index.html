    <h1>Internationalization</h1>
    <h2>What is internationalization?</h2>
    <p>Commonly presented as the shorthand i18n, internationalization is a framework for designing products that fit
        within a local language and culture.</p>
    <h2>What is this webpage for?</h2>
    <p>This webpage takes a user-provided string, and returns that string with its first and last letters sandwiching a
        number, which itself represents the letter count between the first and last letters of the user-provided string.
        i.e. "i18n"</p>
